It was on our roadmap for Q3--and in the MBOs of a few of us on the product team ðŸ™‚. So we just want to look at the dates if we separated it from 4.7. I'll help better coordinate these mobile cross-platform features going forward and take ownership for the dates on this project not converging properly. At some point, we hope to have a cross-team release manager that can work with local program managers to coordinate cross-team features better.",
